# Tournament-Results
Udacity Project2

DESCRIPTION:

In this project, you’ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep 
track of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated,
and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.


Reguirements:

1)Vagrant

2)Virtual Box

3)Python

Files Included In The Project:

1)tournament.sql-Contains of database schemas.

2)tournament.py-Contains of python functions.

3)tournament_test.py- Contains unit tests that will test the functions you’ve written in tournament.py.
You can run the tests from the command line, using the command python tournament_test.py.

How to start with the project:


   - Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
   - Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository
   - Launch the Vagrant VM
   - Write SQL database and table definitions in a file (tournament.sql)
   - Write Python functions filling out a template of an API (tournament.py)
   - Run a test suite to verify your code (tournament_test.py)
